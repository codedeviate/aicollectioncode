# Assembly

Here are the examples in Go from [AICollection](https://codedeviate.github.io/AICollection/assembly.html).

The structure in the Assembly section is a bit different from the other sections since Assembly is a low-level language and thus dependent on architecture.

## Aarch64

The Aarch64 examples are for the ARMv8 architecture. The examples are in the `aarch64` directory.

## x86

The x86 examples are for the Intel x86 architecture. The examples are in the `x86` directory.

## x86_64

The x86_64 examples are for the Intel x86_64 architecture. The examples are in the `x86_64` directory.
